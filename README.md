# imagingbook-maven-demo-project

This is minimal ImageJ project using the [imagingbook-common](https://github.com/imagingbook/imagingbook-common) library.
It contains a single ImageJ plugin that implements the Canny edge detector.

To use:
* Start ImageJ.
* Open a grayscale or color image.
* Run `Plugins` -> `imagingbook_test` -> `Color_Edges_Canny`.

This repository provides Java source code supplementing the digital image processing books by W. Burger & M. J. Burge(see [imagingbook.com](https://imagingbook.com) for details).
