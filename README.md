# imagingbook-maven-demo-project

This is a minimal **[ImageJ](https://imagej.net/ImageJ1)** project that demonstrates how to use the **[imagingbook-common](https://github.com/imagingbook/imagingbook-common)** library.
It contains a single ImageJ plugin that implements the Canny edge detector on color and grayscale images. 
The project uses MAVEN for dependency management and is preconfigured for Eclipse.

**To use:**
* Start ImageJ.
* Open a grayscale or color image.
* Run `Plugins` -> `imagingbook_test` -> `Color_Edges_Canny`.

This repository provides Java source code supplementing the **[Digital Image Processing](https://imagingbook.com)** books by **W. Burger & M. J. Burge**.
