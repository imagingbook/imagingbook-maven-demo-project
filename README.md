# imagingbook-maven-demo-project

This is a minimal ImageJ project using the [imagingbook-common](https://github.com/imagingbook/imagingbook-common) library.
It contains a single ImageJ plugin that implements the Canny edge detector. The project uses MAVEN for dependency management
and is preconfigured for Eclipse.

To use:
* Start ImageJ.
* Open a grayscale or color image.
* Run `Plugins` -> `imagingbook_test` -> `Color_Edges_Canny`.

This repository provides Java source code supplementing the **Digital Image Processing books by W. Burger & M. J. Burge** (see [imagingbook.com](https://imagingbook.com) for details).
